# Eddi Controls
This code runs on the Samsung Artik, where it handles the updating of pins based on user input received.

#Installation
Will need to have Node 4 and higher to run.

Do these steps to prep and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```node index.js```

Note that eddi-sensors must be running for eddi-controls to pick up the readings
